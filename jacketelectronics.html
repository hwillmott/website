        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
        <h4>Don't make the same mistake I did! Pick a scheme (this one) and follow it religiously. For my circuit, the outputs from the fadecandy don't actually follow this color sceme because the breadboard jumpers I ordered were rainbow colored for some reason, but the're a pretty isolated part of the system so it's not that risky.</h4>
        <p>Red: power (+5V)</p>
        <p>Green/Black: Data (din, dout)</p>
        <p>White: ground (gnd)</p>
        <h3>Circuit</h3>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/circuitplusfadecandy.jpg"/>
        <p>This is what the circuit looks like all plugged in. There are 5 lines going from the fadecandy to the proto board, 2 power inputs (one on each side - since the jacket will be powered by a batter which outputs less than 5V per port, I'm splitting it up so that the jacket is powered by 2 output ports from the battery).</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/circuit.jpg"/>
        <p>This is how I am splitting up the power. 2 barrel jacks, 2 capacitors (protect from power surges). There are 2-3 LED outputs on each side, which will total to about 100-110 LEDs on each side.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/circuitcloseupwithlabels.jpg"/>
        <p>This is what each input/output looks like for a set of LEDs. There is data and ground coming out from the fadecandy, then power, ground, and data going out to the LEDs.</p>
        <h3>Arms</h3>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/leftarmwithlabels.jpg"/>
        <p>This is what the right arm looks like. There are 5 stips of LEDs on each the upper and lower arm, with one long line connecting both and a JST connector going to the hand. Notice the arrow direction on the LED strips. Data must always be flowing into the right end of the LEDs.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/soldercorner.jpg"/>
        <p>Here's a closeup of a connection between two strips. One thing we learned while making these jackets is that the best way to hold down the wires while you're soldering them is by pressing them into a little mound of blue poster tac.</p>
        <h3>Hands</h3>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/lefthand.jpg"/>
        <p>Here is what a hand looks like. It's 60 pixel per meter LED strip, with 2 LEDs per finger on the back of the hand and 1 pixel on the knuckle of the thumb.</p>
        <h3>Rings</h3>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringsoldercloseup.jpg"/>
        <p>Here's what the rings look like when they're soldered. NOTE: the inputs to the strip are in a DIFFERENT order than on the LED strips, so make sure you're still following convention and you're not going to fry your LEDs like I did! Also, remember that you can only control 64 LEDs per output from your circuit, so if you're doing this many rings, you'll need 2 different inputs! Cover the connections with electrical tape to protect them.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringbackboard.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Use poster board to make a mount for the rings. Drill holes to line up with the holes on the rings.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringattach.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Attach the rings to the backboard using craft wire.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringattached.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Twist the wire at the back to secure the rings.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringtaped.jpg"/>
        <pstyle="text-align: center;">Tape up the back so nothing gets out of hand.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringwithcorners.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Glue some corner spacers (project board) onto the backboard.<p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringglued.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Glue semitransparent plastic onto the top and secure the edges with packing tape.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/ringpainted.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Paint a black circle around the rings to control ambient light.</p>
