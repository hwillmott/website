        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
        <h4>Don't make the same mistake I did! Pick a scheme (this one) and follow it religiously. For my circuit, the outputs from the fadecandy don't actually follow this color sceme because the breadboard jumpers I ordered were rainbow colored for some reason, but the're a pretty isolated part of the system so it's not that risky.</h4>
        <p>Red: power (+5V)</p>
        <p>Green/Black: Data (din, dout)</p>
        <p>White: ground (gnd)</p>
        <h3>Circuit</h3>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/circuitplusfadecandy.jpg"/>
        <p>This is what the circuit looks like all plugged in. There are 5 lines going from the fadecandy to the proto board, 2 power inputs (one on each side - since the jacket will be powered by a batter which outputs less than 5V per port, I'm splitting it up so that the jacket is powered by 2 output ports from the battery).</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/circuit.jpg"/>
        <p>This is how I am splitting up the power. 2 barrel jacks, 2 capacitors (protect from power surges). There are 2-3 LED outputs on each side, which will total to about 100-110 LEDs on each side.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/ledjacket/circuitcloseupwithlabels.jpg"/>
        <p>This is what each input/output looks like for a set of LEDs. There is data and ground coming out from the fadecandy, then power, ground, and data going out to the LEDs.</p>
