        <h1>Everything I learned about back pain</h1>
        <h2>The neuroscience of pain</h2>
        <p>Pain is not just about tissues and bones: pain is something created by the brain to protect you</p>

        <p>Pain does not always mean that your body is being harmed</p>
        <p>Meditation can REALLY help, as can introspection and working through emotional baggage</p>
        <p>After a serious injury, your brain can be hardwired to feel pain; you need to rehabilitate your body as well as your mind.</p>
        <h2>Sources of pain</h2>
        <h3>Sciatica</h3>
        <p>Sciatica is pain felt down the butt and leg, which is caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve. This can be caused by an inflamed disc putting pressure on the nerve, or by an inflamed muscle squeezing the nerve (it's encased in muscle).</p>
        <h3>Disc(s) pressing against nerves</h3>
        <p>When you hunch your back (as we often do, sitting at a desk), your vertebrae push your discs backwards. When you arch your back backwards, your vertebrae push your discs forwards. If you hunch your back enough, you can push the disc backwards enough to press it against nerves that run down your back and into your legs (sciatica) and other places. When you arch your back too much, you can push the disc forwards enough to press it against your spinal cord and THIS IS SERIOUS and if you start feeling tingling in your groin, speak to a physician. If you lose control of your bladder or bowels, go to the emergency room.</p>
        <h3>Disc(s) being pinched</h3>
        <p>A disc that has been pushed backwards from hunching your back can actually be pinched when you arch your back (the opposite direction), making inflammation worse. Discs can also be pinched if the disc is already inflamed and the muscles along the spine become very short, essentially holding the vertebrae too close together; this is why stretching is important.</p>
        <h3>Miscellaneous nerve pain</h3>
        <p>Tingling anywhere in the body. This can be caused by too much bed rest (e.g. lying on stomach too much wears down nerves in kneecaps, causes tingling from knee caps to toes). It can also be caused by other things, but this is something I struggled with a lot.</p>
        <h3>Muscle pain</h3>
        <p>Could be a torn or overextended muscle, could be caused by bed rest, or from exercise. When you hurt your back, this creates scar tissue, and as the scar tissue heals, you need to make sure it doesn't heal short (tight). You must stretch regularly to keep your mobility and help the muscle heal properly. Take rest days if you're exercising heavily.</p>
        <h3>Bed rest</h3>
        <p>Is fucking terrible for you. 3 days maximum: get up and get moving. If you're worried about spinal compression, go swimming (or walk slowly in the pool, supported around your arms with a pool noodle) and spend as much of the day as possible standing up and pacing slowly, and sitting in chairs with ample lumbar support. Do not sit on a soft, lumpy couch.</p>
        <h3>The Nocebo Effect</h3>
        <p>The opposite of the placebo effect. Now that you've read about all these sources of pain, you're likely to believe one of these scary things is happening to your back right now. Don't panic--go see a physical therapist to help you interpret your symptoms and teach you about your body like a mechanical system, so you can troubleshoot and take care of it.</p>
        <h2>Pain relief</h2>
        <p>GO SEE A PHYSICAL THERAPIST</p>
        <h3>Ice</h3>
        <p>For inflammation, good to do preemptively after exercise or strain. You can put an ice cube directly on the vertebrae in question (‘ice massage') to get a deep numbing.</p>
        <h3>Heat</h3>
        <p>For relaxing muscles. NOTE: MAKES INFLAMMATION WORSE this is probably why lots of advice is to heat, ice, repeat (always end with ice)</p>
        <h3>Traction</h3>
        <p>Pulling the vertebrae apart AKA the opposite of compression. This can be achieved by hanging on monkey bars, standing up and being lightly supported by a pool noodle in a pool, or with a traction setup (some physical therapists have these). NOTE: traction machines can be good for the discs but irritate the muscles. Pay very close attention to how you're feeling while doing this and ALWAYS ice afterwards</p>
        <h3>Topical pain relief</h3>
        <p>I'm a fan of Fisiocrem™ and Voltaren™ </p>
        <h3>Anti-inflammatories</h3>
        <p>Be careful because these damage your gastrointestinal system. Using Advil without food can cause ulcers. The anti-inflammatory that worked for me was Meloxicam (Mobic). You can't drink alcohol while taking this, as it can lead to stomach bleeding.</p>
        <h3>Muscle Relaxants</h3>
        <p>So good! Cyclobenzaprine for the win. However, this loses its effectiveness after a while and I honestly couldn't feel the difference after using it for a number of weeks.</p>
        <h3>CBD & THC</h3>
        <p>THC to help you relax and be optimistic (and sleep), CBD for the actual pain. It won't block it all out (or maybe it will but you need to take a LOT), but it will take the edge off and help you get comfortable (and sleep).</p>
        <h3>Meditation</h3>
        <p>With a serious injury, your brain can become hardwired to feel pain when you're doing everyday activities, which makes it hard (aka feel impossible) to rehabilitate yourself and return to your normal life. Meditation can help you rewire your brain for comfort and give you temporary relief from feelings of stress, dread, panic, etc. I became obsessed with the pain, making it worse and worse. Stress and anxiety are not good for your body. You tense up your muscles and I'm sure all the hormones your brain releases hinder healing. You have to make yourself feel safe and relaxed.</p>
        <h2>Treatment and prevention</h2>
        <h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
        <p>Your body is a complex mechanical system and physical therapists can help you interpret your symptoms and recommend exercises to get you healthy again.</p>

        <a href="http://harrietwillmott.com/assets/fittosit.pdf">stretchs + posture PDF</a><br>

        <p>If something doesn't feel symmetrical (e.g. left hamstring shorter than right), figure out a way to stretch/strengthen it so that it does feel symmetrical</p>
        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>The ultimate low impact and full-body exercise: this is a great way to take care of your muscles in a low-risk environment. If you're really weak, just walk around slowly with a pool noodle and ramp up to real swimming. I have been swimming almost every day for a few weeks and I started out just walking slowly with the noodle, and now I'm swimming laps (with breaks).</p>
        <h3>Medications</h3>
        <p>Anti-inflammatories can help you get your discs back to normal. Muscle relaxants can help your muscles heal. See pain relief for more</p>
        <h3>Listen to your body</h3>
        <p>And understand that some pain is fabricated by the mind. The things your body tells you are still useful, though. Pay very close attention as some feelings are really subtle. You need to be present. If you just did a stretch and the pain lingers, it means you went too far. Use some ice ASAP.</p>
        <h3>Slow and steady</h3>
        <p>Try to challenge yourself every day without fear. Doing this without fear means setting goals that you believe in, like going for a 15-minute walk today if you went for a 10-minute walk yesterday. Whatever you're comfortable with, come up with a plan and be diligent about it. You're building up strength as well as building up confidence.</p>
        <h3>Sitting and standing</h3>
        <p>You want to always maintain the natural curve in your back (lordosis). When active sitting (reading, writing, computing), your pelvis should be tilted forward and your lordosis supported by the back of your chair. When standing, do not cross your arms in front of you. You can cross them behind your back and let them rest in your lordosis and support you, or you can clasp your hands behind your back. Both of these will give you a nice shoulder stretch.</p>
        <h3>The ABCs of lifting</h3>
        <p>Alignment: your head, shoulders and hips should all be aligned</p>
        <p>Base: have a wide stance, so your legs can do the work. If you can't have your feet on either side of the load (like a large box on the ground), try to get a foot as close as possible to the load (like if you're taking a book off the shelf, bring one foot up to the shelf, right underneath the object)</p>
        <p>Core: engage your core so your abs do the work instead of your back</p>
        <p>Squat: bend your knees and life with them as much as possible. NOTE: squatting a lot, especially past 90 degrees and coming up again strains your knees, so do so sparingly. You can also lunge to pick things up</p>

        <p>NOTE: if you're lifting something and your back and core muscles can't handle the load, it gets transferred to your discs, so if you're not aligned, the discs are getting pushed away from their happy place</p>
        <h2>Things that strain your back</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hunching over to tie up your shoes</li>
            <li>Looking down while brushing your teeth or washing dishes</li>
            <li>Leaning over the sink to wash your hands</li>
            <li>Lifting anything (especially without core support)</li>
            <li>If you're lifting something above your belly button, you will tend to arch your back. If below, you will tend to hunch. Fight this urge by engaging your core and paying attention</li>
            <li>Opening heavy or sticky drawers</li>
            <li>Leaning back in a chair without lumbar support(your core cannot support you in that position)</li>
            <li>Crossing your arms in front of you while standing</li>
            <li>Looking down at your phone</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Things that you can do differently</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Always use a shopping cart instead of a basket</li>
            <li>Use a dolly to bring your groceries home, don't carry them in your arms</li>
            <li>Open doors by stepping back, not torquing your torso</li>
            <li>Stabilize yourself with your other hand on the counter when picking up the kettle</li>
            <li>Bend your knees to lower yourself so you don't have to lean over the sink to wash your hands</li>
            <li>Whenever you're reaching, bending, your spine should always take the shape of a C. Don't use vertebrae like joints (all the bend at one point, usually L4-5); try to spread the curve over all of them</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Misc</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For every movement, there is a muscle that pulls and a muscle that pushes. You can use these muscles to stretch safely (e.g. hamstring stretch). By pushing yourself into that position with those muscles (not pulling with your arms), it's very hard to overstretch</li>
            <li>Try to make your body symmetrical (stretch and strengthen so each side is equally flexible and strong)</li>
            <li>My right shoulder is a little unstable, so I need to be careful not to dislocate it, and I can't stabilize it with muscle because it's different ligaments that keep it in the joint</li>
            <li>You can move your vertebrae with your fingers, like a little massage, in your neck and your back. Use 2 fingers from each hand, one on top of the other so you don't strain your fingers</li>
            <li>You're more likely to hurt your back in the morning, as your spine is all decompressed from sleeping</li>
            <li>Only lift one leg to your chest at a time; your back can't support lifting both at once.</li>
            <li>Discs don't just slip around. They're pretty hard to move; it's repetitive stress that causes a herniated disc.</li>
            <li>Discs just wear out with strain. They can take only so much over a lifetime, so build up your core and optimize your lifestyle for a healthy back</li>
            <li>You always want to support the curve of your neck if it's hanging backwards</li>
            <li>NEVER lean down and reach for your toes while standing up. It's too much strain! There are safer and gentler ways to stretch</li>
            <li>Leaning forward when talking to people will tire out your back quickly</li>
        </ul>
