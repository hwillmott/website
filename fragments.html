            <p>Fragments was a sort of last-minute project to make a LED installation for the ceiling of our shade structure at Burning Man. I was originally inspired by Firmament, which is a LED installation I had heard about that was at Burning Man in 2015. It is composed of traingular canopies of LEDs. The visualizations are programmed to go with classical music. It is very beautiful.</p>
            <p>So, I ordered some LEDs that come in strings of 50 LEDs, spaced apart with 5" between. I decided that, since there wasn't much time left and I was already working on the jackets, that I would just do a 15x15 grid of LEDs as a canopy to hang in our shade structure. However, I couldn't think of a good way to make the lines really straight. The LED wire was pretty rigid, and corners were going to be a problem. I thought about reinforcing the lines with wire, but then I realized if I was going to go to all the effort to reinforce the same, making it much less portable and easy to deal with, I might as well make some shapes that are a little more interesting than a square grid.</p>
            <p>I ended up making these fragments by laying the LEDs on project board to get a general layout, then cutting the project board and drilling holes to poke the LEDs through. The LEDs are (barely) attached to the project board with hot glue. The gifs show them lying on the floor of our living room, which is where they lived for most of August while I was programming them, but when installed, they hung between a layer of wire mesh and fish netting.</p>
            <p>I wanted these to look like you were holding a pane of glass, then dropped it and it shattered into pieces, but you could still see reflections across the surface of the glass.</p>
