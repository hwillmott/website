        <h4>Now the hard part: attach the LEDs to the jacket.</h4>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/sewstrips.jpg"/>
        <p>I decided to sew little sleeves for each individual LED strip by hand because I wanted the fabric to be stretched around the strip evenly. I experimented with making sleeves with a sewing machine, but it was too hard to feed the strips through unless is the sleeve was so wide that it was too loose anyways. I also thought about making one big sleeve, but there needs to be some way to keep the strips lined up with each other. You really do not want them moving around or overlapping each other.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/sewstripstogether.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Then I sewed the strips together to make a panel. I did this with the LEDs plugged in and on to make sure the pixels were lined up nicely.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/armsewn.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Then I sewed the panel onto the sleeve of my jacket just by stitching the edges to the sleeve.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/handsewn.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Here's what a hand looks like.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/glovesewn.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">This is what it looks like attached to the glove.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/ringssewn.jpg"/>
        <p style="text-align: center;">This is what the rings looked like attached to the chest. It's attached with velcro on one side  so I can unzip the jacket.</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="/images/jacket/insidejacket.jpg"/>
        <p>This is what the inside of the jacket looks like. There is a travel pouch sewn into the jacket in the back for the battery, and power cords go from there around the left side to the circuit and the Odroid. The circuit has it's own sketchy pocket above the regular hoodie pocket, and there is a hole in the top of the regular pocket for a USB cable to go from the Odroid to the circuit.</p>
