        <p>This website is a collection of some of my favourite experiments with the graphics language, Processing. I began by reading and coding through some of the tutorials in a book called Generative Gestaltung, which focuses on generating visuals based on some kind of input data or random seed. This is also where I learned about the Perlin Noise function, which is present in many of my sketches.</p>
        <p>I began with regular Processing sketches, then graduated to mixed-media sketches like this one. Most of this sketch is drawn with pen on paper, and the dots on the belly of the snake are animated to look like (I imagine) bubbles in a glass of beer. I like mixed media sketches because they remind me of myself as a child, drawing something and wishing I could make part of my picture move, like leaves blowing in the wind, or waves on the ocean.</p>
        <p>This year, I also discovered the joys of programming LEDs with the Processing language. I started with an LED strip, then decided to make an LED panel (1 dimension was not enough), then made an LED jacket for Burning Man, as well as an installation for the ceiling of our shade structure, and now I'm working on another installation for a wall. This site includes some videos of these projects as well as some tutorials.</p>
