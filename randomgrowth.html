<div style="position: absolute; top: 100; left: 50; width: 350; z-index: 2"><p>This was my first generative processing sketch, which is essentially a modified version of a tutorial from the Generative Gestaltung book. It starts with a cell in the center, then at each step, a random-ish coordinate is generated on the screen and then a cell is drawn next to an existing cell that is nearest to the generated coordinate.</p>
<p>The coordinates that are generated are not exactly random. When I just used random number generation, the structure always ended up as a cross. I experimented with a lot of different formulas to try to get something that looked organic, and ended up with something pretty complicated and I'm not sure I remember the reasoning anymore, but it's on github if you're really interested.</p>
