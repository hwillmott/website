        <p>The fragments drifting up off of the raven are generated randomly. There are about 50 at any time and they spawn behind the raven. When one spawns, it is given a speed, a size factor, and a starting angle. Points are generated around a circle, at different (random-ish * size factor) distances from the starting point, by incrementing the angle by a random amount for every point and stopping after the angle is greater than 2 * PI</p>
        <p>The lifetime of the fragment is determined by its speed. As it gets farther from the raven, it becomes more transparent and eventually 'dies', to be replaced by another fragment.</p></div>
